📌 Definition & Characteristics
Linked list = nodes connected via references.

Each node contains:

data

next (pointer to the next node)

Non-contiguous memory allocation.

Dynamic size.

⚙️ Insertion
Point the previous.next → newNode

newNode.next → nextNode

Time Complexity:

Insertion: O(1)

Searching: O(n)

💡 When to Use?
✅ Use LinkedList for insertion/deletion.

❌ Avoid for searching – prefer ArrayList.

🧱 Node Structure in Java

Copy
Edit
class ListNode {
    int data;
    ListNode next;

    ListNode(int data) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = null;
    }
}
🔁 Types of Linked List
Singly Linked List

One direction only (head → ... → tail → null)

Java uses object references instead of pointers.
