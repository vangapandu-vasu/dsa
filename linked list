linked list
here one node points to other nodes.
linked list is variable size.
data is stored in non-contiguous data.

insertion:
add node in between point the provious and next to it 
time complexity for insertion is 0(1) constant time.
time complexity for searching is 0(n).

key point:
for insertion deletion like manipulation use linked list over arraylist
for searching use arraylist over linked list
