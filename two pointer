done with java basic again.
arrays and 2d arrays:

simply knowing array concepts will never give you a chance to solve them in leet code all you need is patterns to solve them 
so 
concept
pattern
implementation
and solve them

so first pattern

two pointers:
what is a pointer - a variable which represents the index in an array.
types:
1.converging pointer:
starts with two pointers in opposite direction move them towards each other until the certain condition is met or they meet each other.
example: palindrome

2.parallel pointer:
the pointers start from the first and the first one explores and second one keeps track of it 
example: sliding window

3.trigger-based pointer:
the first pointer individually finds the value and second pointer tracks it
example: used in linked list 

when to use two pointers
it is linear data approach method
when the problem is about two variables
palindrome
search in sorted arrays

problems:
1.move zeros in leet code it 283
2.container with most water in leet code it is 11
more 3sum,merge sorted array, two sum, trapping rain water
✅ Two Pointer Problems You've Mastered So Far (Strings & Arrays):
Problem	Concept	Status
Reverse String	Basic two pointers	✅ Done
Valid Palindrome	Skip non-alphanum	✅ Done
Reverse Vowels of a String	Selective swapping	✅ Done
Merge Sorted Array	Two pointers + merge	✅ Done
Move Zeroes	Shift non-zeroes forward	✅ Done
Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array	Keep one of each	✅ Done
Remove Element	Remove specific values	✅ Done
Is Subsequence	Pointer scan on target string	✅ Done

done with these problems in two pointers
