done with java basic again.
arrays and 2d arrays:

simply knowing array concepts will never give you a chance to solve them in leet code all you need is patterns to solve them 
so 
concept
pattern
implementation
and solve them

so first pattern

two pointers:
what is a pointer - a variable which represents the index in an array.
types:
1.converging pointer:
starts with two pointers in opposite direction move them towards each other until the certain condition is met or they meet each other.
example: palindrome

2.parallel pointer:
the pointers start from the first and the first one explores and second one keeps track of it 
example: sliding window

3.trigger-based pointer:
the first pointer individually finds the value and second pointer tracks it
example: used in linked list
