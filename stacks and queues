ðŸ“š STACKS AND QUEUES IN JAVA

Step 1: Concepts
ðŸ“¦ Stack: LIFO (Last-In, First-Out)
â†’ Think: Undo operations, parentheses matching

ðŸ“¬ Queue: FIFO (First-In, First-Out)
â†’ Think: Task scheduling, printer queue

ðŸ“¦ STACK
ðŸ§  Concept:
Stack is a LIFO structure (Last In, First Out). Think of a stack of plates â€” the last one you put on is the first you take off.
import java.util.Stack;

Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();

// Push elements
stack.push(10);

// Pop element
int popped = stack.pop();

// Peek (top element without removing)
int top = stack.peek();

// Check if empty
boolean empty = stack.isEmpty();
