Sorting
In base we 3 sorting algorithms:
1.Bubble sort
In bubble sorting we take the largest element and place it in the last of thee array and shorten the array from the last
In mean we take large array and place in last place then it is sorted from last
We compare every adjacent value and place the largest value at the end.
